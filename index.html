    <h2>Personal Statement</h2> <br />
    <p id="paragraph" class="txt">
        It is my career goal to become successful within the field of IT. In order to achieve this I have undertaken the following measures. I am currently enrolled in Angela Yu's web development bootcamp, hosted via Udemy. This course covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, MongoDB, Web3 and DApps and more. Earlier this year (2023) I completed the Google IT Support Professional certificate. This certification covers topics such as Technical Support Fundamentals, Computer Networking (5 layer model), Operating Systems (Windows and Linux), System Administration and IT security. I believe that this certification combined with my passion and drive to be successful in IT will provide me with the grounding I need to be a valuable employee. Above all I am Disciplined and a hard worker who will get the job done efficiently and effectively
        <br />
        <br />
        I have a variety of experience in different areas of work and so I provide a good level of flexibility and general knowledge for any position. My varied background has also given me the confidence to take the initiative on the job and ask questions early on to be as effective as possible from the start.  I am confident, motivated, and reliable. I pick up knew skills quickly and can think on the spot to solve problems. I am well educated and have a good knack for communication and teamwork. I take pride in my work ethic and can provide new helpful perspectives when needed. I do not currently hold a full UK driving license, but I am currently enrolled in lessons and on track to pass this summer (2023).

            Actelligent - 83 Princes Street, Edinburgh, Scotland, EH2 2ER<br /></h3> 
            <h4>Data Scientist .  December 2021 – March 2022 <br /></h4>
            <br />Actelligent is a fintech firm that leverages the power of machine learning and data science to enhance investment returns. It targets investors from all around the world and uses a differentiated Thematics + Factors hybrid approach. I worked here as a data scientist, my duties included tuning and troubleshooting output from an AI model, Preparing and cleaning data required for AI models, and conducting innovative and scientific research to identify and model macro and fundamental drivers of performance and risks. This position came with a lot of responsibility. The data I was handling was very large sets, sometimes hundreds of thousands of rows per set. This research and cleaning done with this data was at the core of the company’s engine for profit and so it was critical that I carried out my job correctly and met the deadlines. My skill set used for this job was self-taught and it was common for me to teach myself a new skill on the job in order to complete a task. I worked from home with Actelligent and so I grew accustomed to cooperating with a global team to integrate the output into our solutions for clients. Parts of the job involved handling sensitive data not accessible to the general public and so I also learned the importance of being committed to the highest ethical standards and to act with professionalism and integrity. This job provided me with strong interpersonal skills and the ability to work collaboratively with all levels of staff and to thrive in a team-oriented environment.
